# Stellplats
This repository contains an Android application called Stellplats (or Ställplats in swedish). It's an app for finding off-street parking/camping in Sweden.

## Download
Right now it is *not* possible to download this app in any other way that cloning/downloading this source code and compile it in Eclipse or Android SDK. In time there will be an Android Market version too.

## Translations
Right now the app only comes with english (default) and swedish translations. My plan is to start using Transifex to be able to add more translations in the future. But this is still work in progress...

## More information
Swedish users can soon visit [Campingwebben](http://www.campingwebben.se/ "Svenska ställplatser hos Campingwebben") to get more information about this app.
